Figure 1: Extinction laws
=========================

Avalaible extinction laws from extinction.py
       

Goobar law
----------

Set the values for the MW dust:
- a = 0.90
- p = -1.50
- Corresponding: Rv =2.79
        

CCM law
-------

- CCM law for Rv = 3.1
- CCM law for Rv = 2.8
        

Fitzpatrick law
---------------
        Fitzpatrick law for Rv = 3.1
        
Use the standard set of parameters for MW:
c3=3.23; c2=0.70; x0=4.60; c1=-0.07; gamma=0.99; c4=0.41

        -------O'Donnel 94 law--------
        O'Donnel 94 law for Rv = 3.1

        
=======================Figure 2: Cardelli extinction law========================

        Top panel: Cardelli extinction law parammeters a and b (top pannel).
        Bottom panel:
        - CCM extinction law as A(lbd)/Av = a+b/Rv for Rv = 3.10
        - Interstellar medium transmission for Rv = 3.10 and E(B-V) = 0.30.

        
===================Figure 3: CCM law variability (A(lbd)/Av)====================

        Cardelli extinction law for several values of Rv. This figure express
        the extinction law variability as a function af Rv.

===================Figure 4: CCM law variability (R(lbd)-Rv)====================

        CCM law expressed as R(lbd)-Rv for several values of Rv.

=======================Figure 5: Transmission variability=======================

        Dust cloud transmission variablitiy as a function of Rv and E(B-V).
        A degeneracy between the Rv and E(B-V) variabilities can be seen
        in the IR.
