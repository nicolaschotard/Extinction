- Errors on E(B-V) are available for a few maps, but not yet
  accessible here. But this will come soon.
- A few extinction laws are already available, but not yet fully
  tested nor interfaced with the E(B-V) query tools.
- A set of magnitudes systems has to be implemented (started in
  `utils.py` for now).
