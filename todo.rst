.. todo:: Errors on E(B-V) are available for a few maps, but not yet accessible here. But this will come soon.
.. todo:: A few extinction laws are already available, but not yet fully tested nor interfaced with the E(B-V) query tools.
.. todo:: A set of magnitudes systems has to be implemented (started in `utils.py` for now).
